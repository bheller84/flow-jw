# Flow for JW Player

The Flow plugin provides slick, 3D animation playlist effects for users to flip through their playlist items. The plugin automatically grabs thumbnail images from any playlist and renders them three-dimensionally in a row. Users can navigate through the playlist by clicking on a thumbnail image or using the left/right arrow keys and space bar to select items.

Since version 2, the Flow plugin even works on iPhone and iPad in HTML5 mode.
